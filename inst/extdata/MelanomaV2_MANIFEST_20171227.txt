# Example manifest file
#
# This manifest will be used as input to our script and will also
# be kept for our records
#
# Immediately below a comment section (no header) will be tab-delimited rows of key/value
# pairs to be read by script and put into a list
#
# A third, optional column may contain notes but MUST be an 
# actual third column (i.e., there must be a tab after the 
# second column)
#
# Values that are vectors (e.g., altBases) should be delimited by commas
