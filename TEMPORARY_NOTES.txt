The script 

    selene:/home/byrne/halo/dev/halodev/scripts/final_pipeline.pl

1) parses all study meta data
2) parses and stores all halo boundaries
3) marks exclusions
4) generates combination table (I recently made changes to this so I'm not sure how well it works right now)
5) calculates & plots total areas and densities for each FOV (see notes below about marker & plot config files); also this needs some major cleaning
6) calculates interface areas 
7) TO BE ADDED: interface density calculation and plotting


The main input to this script is a config file in YAML format. See example: 


    selene:/home/byrne/halo/data/template_configs/example_study_config.yaml 

* for post-rethreshold data, modify this file with new input and output files/directories and rerun  



Pipeline NOTES:

* use /home/byrne/R/R-3.4.3

* can't get halodev to install any more; temporary hack is to load library as-is so that all dependencies are loaded (this also needs to be fixed eventually to load only what is needed when it is needed), and source all scripts in R directory of package

* it is set up so that if a particular output file exists and nothing upstream has changed, that section of the code will not run (similar to our other pipelines)

* for density analyses, a marker config file and a plot config file are required in YAML format. See examples:

    selene:/home/byrne/halo/data/template_configs/template_marker_config.yaml
    selene:/home/byrne/halo/data/template_configs/template_plot_config.yaml

* if changing config for different analyses, make sure to change output directories in study config file so that files are not overwritten

* counts SHOULD now match Nick's counts tables

* plotting that is currently in the pipeline is not quite finished and can just be ignored for now



OTHER NOTES:

* To ONLY add Cell_Type and Subtype to Nick's counts tables, use script 

    /home/byrne/halo/dev/halodev/scripts/add_marker_combo_interpretations.R (run with -h to see usage)
