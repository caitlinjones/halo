\title{Calculate total area and density of tumor interface}
\usage{
calculateInterfaceArea(aFiles, dat, pad, writeCSVfiles = TRUE, maxG = 5,
  outDir = NULL, statsByBand = FALSE, interfaceBins = (-20:20) * 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{aFiles}{a vector of Halo boundary annotation files, with 
'.annotations' extension in XML format}

\item{pad}{amount to trim from FOV before calculating}

\item{writeCSVfiles}{logical indicating whether to write density and area tables to file; 
default=TRUE}

\item{maxG}{the maximum factor of 10 to use for generating random points for area calculation}

\item{outDir}{if writeCSVfiles=T, directory to which these files will be written}

\item{statsByBand}{logical; return stats broken down by interface bands (bins) as opposed to total
stats; default=FALSE}

\item{interfaceBins}{a vector of distances from tumor interface in which cells will be binned; 
default=(-20:20)*10}

\item{data}{Halo data for one sample, loaded from *.rda file}
}
\value{
a list containing two tables: 'density' and 'area'
}

Calculate area and density of cells within a given distance to a tumor boundary
