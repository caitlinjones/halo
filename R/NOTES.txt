General workflow:

1) parse meta data and generate yaml config file(s)

2) create *.rda files from ObjectAnalysisData.csv files
    - Nick's code
    - add Zheng's exclusions

3) run counts of all possible combinations (marker combo table)
    ** this is per sample, but for all FOV combined; still need to run
       computeMultiMarkerCounts() to get counts per FOV for particular marker combos
    ** basic QC step

4) calculate area for 10micron bands, +/- 360 microns from tumor interfaces; this 
   will be standard
    ** store *rda files with area per band and band assignments
    ** may run again for different band widths, but can also just filter for a smaller
       total span (e.g., +/- 200)

5) calculate density for any given marker sets using stored area files (3) and data files (1)
    ** store in *.rda files?

6) plot by band and total density, by FOV and by sample, stacked and unstacked
